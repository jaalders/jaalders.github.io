excerpt: <img src="/images/fulls/papers.jpg" class="image fit"> I finally got around to making a GitHub Pages blog. It's been an interesting time thus far because, I know things for me aren't always immediately intuitive and sometimes there is a bit of a grind to make things work. I often would joke with colleagues and say that for every day of work they put in, I would have to put in two. Just to have the retention they would overall.

## My challenge ... and my tweak to it
So, in my quest to leverage chatGPT as much as possible, I simply asked it. "what is simpler to learn, React or Angular?" I was definitely a little surprised when the results came back with React as the winner. With that being said I still plan on doing the challenge, but I am just changing my front end of choice to now be React since I will need all the help I can get since learning is slow at best for this guy.

## chatGPT paying dividends
Wanting to figure out the best way to approach this, I literally just asked chatGPT to design me a 100 day lesson plan that would cover all the topics that I previously mentioned here and it didn't disappoint. Here's a sample of what it was able to come up with.

> Days 1-5: Introduction to Software Development
> - Introduction to programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and software development principles.
> - Overview of the .NET Framework, C# programming language, and React.js library.
> - Setting up a development environment (Visual Studio Code, .NET Core, Node.js, npm, Git).

> Days 6-10: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Fundamentals
> - Understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
> - Creating a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
> - Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM).

It's kind of scary, but also it's amazing to have this tool to assist you and really give you a launchpad. Do you think that I would be able to make my own lesson plan. Heck no! But this really allows me to have a focused outline to at least provide some bounds in my learning.

It's kind of crazy the amount of simple things I have done with chatGPT thus far. Its even helped me write this blog post in all honest.
There is a lot of little things that I want to write about and it's almost like I need Notion or something along those longs to really keep my thoughts together.

## Speaking of dividends...
This whole experience of writing everything has been interesting so far. There has been a lot of learning that has already been happening and I haven't really even got into the whole coding side of things yet (yes, I guess one could see this as an excuse) but I would like to thing that this all hasn't been for nothing.

Things I have learned already in this endeavour
- Learned about DNS settings and things like TTL and what A vs AAAA means and what a CNAME does.
- Learned about GitHub Pages and what the purpose of it is.
- Learned about Jekyll and how markdown language works
- Learned sometimes it is best to call tech support :)

## Future plans?
So I think in terms of what is next. It's going to basically be following along with the guide that chatGPT has outlined to me and seeing how committed I can be to the learning plan. I think it will be beneficial for sure, and the blog definitely will allow me to have more accountability for sure.

PS. I still have to fix my domain stuff. I was tinkering around with it and I really caused an issue with the domain forward as opposed to using GH-P's infrastructure secret sauce to make it all work and needless to say I broke the damn thing. Hopefully I can fix the domain stuff again here shortly cause I did have it all working at one point.

Until the next day!
