## This is probably going to be a quick blog post
I know it's been a couple of days since my last post. I have not given up on my challenge at all. In fact, [here is a link to my react to-do app](https://github.com/jaalders/react-to-do). It's definitely nothing crazy and I certainly have a bit to learn about states and whatnot, but understanding the little things like what the `...` operator does in advance is a big help.

## Not super feeling the theme
Many moons ago before I even had my GitHub Pages repo set up, I had this theme picked out. I don't know why, but I knew when I finally did get around to it (I think it's been years??) That I was going to use this theme. And well, I did. Don't get me wrong. It's great and it does what I need it to do, but I don't find it super slick and it really only stands out on really, really big monitors, 27" or larger big. I don't know if I want to have this same styling or if perhaps I can find something slick to transition over to.

Short post for today! More React fun later!
