## GitHub Pages
I finally got around to making a GitHub Pages blog. It's been an interesting time thus far because, I know things for me aren't always immediately intuitive and sometimes there is a bit of a grind to make things work. I often would joke with colleagues and say that for every day of work they put in, I would have to put in two. Just to have the retention they would overall.

## Ruby Strikes again!
Ruby threw me a curve ball. You follow along with installation guides and they kind of assume that you're starting fresh. I however at some point in my past decided to install Ruby previously within WSL. So it kind of made it tricky figuring out what version I needed for what bundler and whatnot since a version was already installed. Needless to say, I have never been a fan of Ruby. I still am not.

## chatGPT
It's been a couple of weeks now since I have started up an account with openAI, and I have to say some of the things it can do is powerful. It can really assist you in putting thoughts together, helping you figure out solutions to problems you weren't too sure of how to approach, and I know that I am only scratching the surface. It's a really odd spot to be in because you don't want to be part of "skynet" or the wave that triggered the downfall of society. But, with that all being said. AI certainly isn't going away and it can be a tool to really supercharge your life and it really comes down to how you phrase your questions to the AI. 

## The Challenge!
So! One of the things that I have been trying to do is evolve my skill set as a developer. What I have decided to do is to get this website going on my GitHub Pages. (if you're reding this. ta-da!) and use this as a online journal of sorts to document my way through my own kind of #100daysOfCoding challenge. I think it would be beneficial for me to really keep myself accountable and I feel like having a daily blog is something that I can just have my thoughts and to show my progress as I step through the days/code.

The things I want to learn about during all this:
- .NET
- TS
- Angular
- charting libraries

Here's where things get fun! I am going to use the power of chatGPT to help me make a lesson plan of sorts to really put me to task on this idea of mine and see what potentially we can come up with.

I don't know what the end outcome for the #100daysOfCoding challenge or if I am even calling it that. But this will be the start. #day1done
